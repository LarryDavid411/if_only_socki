You throw on your black coat and rummage through your workbench to find your vision goggles and ClusterNet key. You grab your boots and run downstairs. It's still red out. Today is stage 4 car-smog day meaning the sun won't shine for at least another week. It's been over 15 years since the last car was legally sold in Texas but we're still dealing with the scorched sky.

and notice that it's flowing over its banks. Normally, you can see the old car roadway that ran alongside the river but with the recent flooding to the west, the river is  {dreamSequence1: "...Back when I lived in Houston, the train neeeaaaaaaaaa ..a...f..d.f........d..."} {dreamSequence1: "I'LL KILL HIM!!!" ...} much higher than ususal.

A couple of stops before you arrive at West End Station, the streetcar approaches Union Station. You had a gig a few weeks ago at Union where you hashed a full 16 PB of data to some small town transit station in Winnemuca, Nevada. 

//For years, the streetcar just ended at Union Station and you'd have to walk half a mile to make a transfer.

    -> gigDelayWalk
    
=== gigDelayWalk ===
You run a delay signal to Larry for the Gig which is AutoAccepted.

Crossing the bridge over the Trinity Canal used to be such a pain when people drove on it but after they started to ban cars, there wasn't much use for the interstate to have 12 unused lanes. Quickly afterwards, the city started to allow buildings to be built right in the center of the old roads. 

//When you stroll through the bridge’s neighborhood, you imagine the hundreds of thousands of cars that raced across this same space. Another reason for the car ban was the death and destruction left if their wake. People used to get really hurt and die in those things which is an unimaginable thought. Not only did people drive these things, but cities used to actually be designed around shuttling people		Entire segments of downtown were leveled to for temporary storage of them!
{dreamSequence1: You notice a few sky scrapers that you never regonized before. One of them looks like a replica of the World Trade Center and is shining two becons strait into the sky. }

Th crosded bridge is always a pretty great place to find some cool networking items. You pass by the DigiNoise Salon. They alsways get updated items and like to check in to see what's new whevnever you can.

Do you want to go in?

The grand doors open into a vast hall with people speedily walking in all different directions.
