I downloaded the Ink program and just started to writing a story in it one path after the other. 

It’s not great or anything as I’ve never done this before and I also just kinda starting making it up as I went along while learning the program. It’s about someone who wakes in up in some sci-fi Neuromancer-esqe future set in Dallas. 

The first question in the game is to choose to go back to sleep or to wake up. Although I haven’t finished implementing it into the code quite yet, the idea is that if you choose to keep sleeping, you’ll eventually wake up and continue the same story line as if you had chosen to not sleep, but during the progression of the story, dream type hallucinations and other strange things will happen to the character in the story.

The Ink code specifically allows you to trigger special events depending on which ‘path’ you take in the story which is kinda cool.

If anyone wants to do anything with this, please feel free and/or let me know.
